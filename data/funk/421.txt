Feeling the song, party done
Shadows walking home
Walking with our game on
You are my kind, classic mind, and you look so fine
Mm, mm-mm mm
Loving the cold, smoke a roll
See your fingers shake
I'm getting through your heart break
Some kinda freak, sing for me, don't know what I need
Mm, mm-mm, mm
Don't doubt me babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay
I can't
Bite me babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay
I can't
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me falling right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mm, mm-mm mm)
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mm, mm-mm mm)
I'm getting the door, silent walk
Whose the first to speak?
Speak it like a real freak
Voice in my head, in my bed
Filled with you instead
Mm, mm-mm mm
Taking your time, work my mind
And I play with you
I play pretend it's so true
Follow me down, listen 'round to the deep dark sound
Mm, mm-mm mm
Don't doubt me babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay
I can't
Bite me babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay
I can't
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me falling right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mm, mm-mm mm)
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mm, mm-mm mm
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't doubt me babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay
I can't
Bite me babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed, don't make me wanna stay
I can't
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me falling right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mm, mm-mm mm)
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mm, mm-mm mm)
