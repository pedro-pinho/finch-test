You spoke a word and life began
Told oceans where to start and where to end
You set in motion time and space
But still you come, and you call to me by name
But still you come, and you call to me by name
If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars
The deepest depths, the darkest nights
Can't separate, can't keep me from your sight
I get so lost, forget my way
But still you love, and you don't forget my name
If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am lifting up my heart
If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me
You're never too far away
You never show up too late
So here I am lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars
Your love has called my name
What do I have to fear?
What do I have to fear?
Your love has called my name
What do I have to fear?
What do I have to fear?
If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am lifting up my heart (lifting up my heart)
If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me
You're never too far away
You never show up too late
So here I am lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars
You're the one who holds the stars
