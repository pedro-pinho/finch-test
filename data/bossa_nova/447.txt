Malibu barbie and punk rock ken
Went to a party in beverly hills
Just thinking about it still gives me the chills
Malibu barbie and punk rock ken
When down to the valley then came back up again
They didn't talk about nothing at all
They just style style style at the local dance hall
Equestrian barbie shot daggers at them
So astronaut barbie said let's go to apple pan"

Malibu barbie and punk rock ken
Balenciaga barbie took givenchy's barbie hair
And told that girl she'd better get out of there
So prada barbie took valentino barbie's hand
And jumped in the van of the brasileiro band
They didn't talk about nothing at all
They just style style style at the local dance hall
Malibu barbie and punk rock ken
Never the twain shall meet again
Meet again
Like again,like again
Like again,like again..
