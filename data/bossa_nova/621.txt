Who needs another rock song
Hustler girl, Hustler girl
I love you platinum blond hair
Hustler girl, Hustler girl
You know everybody in town
Hustler girl, Hustler girl
Agora sem você
A vida é um quadro em branco para preencher
Tem dor no coração
Mas tem amor para dar e vender
And I
The one that gave you everything that I had
The one that did everything that I could
The one that you left in this world
The one that would not let you go
The one that never said no to you
Hustler girl, Hustler girl, Hustler girl
Hustler girl
Don't leave me
Hustler girl, Hustler girl, Hustler girl
Hustler girl
Don't leave me
Hustler girl
