This is just a little samba,
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow,
But the root is still that note
Now this new one is the consequence,
Of the one we've just been through
As i'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you
There's so many people who can talk
And talk and talk and just say nothing,
Or nearly nothing
I have used up all the scale i know, and at the end i've come to nothing,
Or nearly nothing
So i come back to my first note,
As i must come back to you
I will pour into that one note,
All the love i feel for you
Anyone who wants the whole show,
Re mi fa sol la si do
He will find himself with no show,
Better play the note you know
