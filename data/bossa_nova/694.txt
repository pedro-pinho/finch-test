Avec notre passé pour guide,
On se devrait d'être lucide.
Mais notre méfiance est à bout.
L'amour est bien plus fort que nous.
When we are close, the world is singing.
And when we touch, the night is winging.
And there's no way to disagree.
For love is ‘tronger far than we.
When hearts are meant for caring.
And lives are meant for sharing.
Then we are joined by destiny.
And love is ‘tronger far than we.
So, we may say another season.
May say goodbye and find the reason.
But love decides how things must be.
And love is ‘tronger far than we.

And love is ‘tronger far than we.
