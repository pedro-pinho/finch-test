Summer is on the way
I feel the waves like a warm embrace,
Summer is like a friend
wide open arms and good things to say
Summer I just can't help but to feel
While I sleep I dream brighter days
Couldn't wait
just realized I left the sorrow 
and all the cold behind
Troubles are castles made of sand
And as we hold each other side by side 
I saw a bright shine in your eyes
Like the horizon of the newest day
Summer is on the way, 
with open doors and a place to stay
Summer I just can't help but to feel,
While I sleep I dream brighter days

Summer, I asked your name
You said you'll stay, but then you fade
