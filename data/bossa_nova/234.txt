I’m just sitting by myself
Tonight, oh well
Pulling melodies from hell
And off the shelf
Coming up with something new
Sounding cool to me and you
Coming up with something new
Sounding cool to me and you
Those melodies from hell
The beat that I’m compelled
Those melodies from hell
They serve the story well
Those melodies from hell
They sing the song and tell
The beat that I’m compelled
Those melodies from hell
