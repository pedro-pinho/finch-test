And by the way have you forgotten to say
Where you live, what's your name, what you do
In case you're free
We can go you and me to the zoo
And may I ask you what you to do with your days,
With your nights, with your time, with your life
Suppose I dare to ask what are you doing tonight
If you're free I can lend you these wings for a flight
Haven't we met?
I can't remember but yet I could swear I have seen you before
But if you're scared of my boat
I can take you ashore
Or would you rather catch the wind
That blows steady and pulls to the high open sea
You are the force that irresistible might
That creates in me the power of flight
We're kites in the sky
We can fly, we can fly
We can fly, we can fly
I get a flash of your thigh like a spy in the sky
I see thy heavenly thighs in the skies, in the skies
There where the sea meets the sky
You and me, you and I
Give me a moment just to finish this brew to undo the voodoo
That kept you away
For so long
For so long
For so long
La la la la ...
Suppose I give you this rose and you give me a kiss
Suppose we take off our clothes
And we plunge in the sea
And just dismiss with a kiss la petite burgeoisie
Haven't we met?
I can't remember but yet I could swear I have seen you before
But if you're scared of my boat
I can take you ashore
Or would you rather catch the wind
That blows steady and pulls to the high open sea
You are the force that irresistible might
That creates in me the power of flight
We're kites in the sky
We can fly, we can fly
We can fly, we can fly
I see thy heavenly thighs
In the skies, in the skies
There where the sea meets the sky
You and me you and I
La la la la ...
For so long
For so long
