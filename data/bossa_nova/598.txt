Sometimes I wonder where you'll go
Without me by your side
And what if you don't make it?
Sometimes, I wonder how you've been,
And if maybe you still hold
A part of me inside of you
Look around and you will find
All you left behind
And now, where did you go?
You're on your own
You put a ocean in between us
And sometimes I try to forget
Do you feel the storm ?
Maybe it's too late to make it... (right)
Sometimes I wonder if you care
About all that has passed
Was it all a lie said?
Sometimes you can call me if you want
You know it's all your fault
That no one's there beside you.
