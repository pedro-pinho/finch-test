Ela é carioca, she's a carioca
Just see the way she walks
Nobody else can be what she is to me
I look and what do I see
When I look deep in her eyes
I can see the sea
A forgoten road
The caressing skies
And not only that, I'm in love with her
The most exciting way
It's written on my lips
Where her kisses stay
She smiles and all of a sudden
The world is smiling for me
And you know what else
She's a carioca
Ela é carioca
Ela é carioca, ela é carioca
Basta o jeitinho dela andar
Nem ninguem tem carinho assim para dar
Eu vejo na luz dos seus olhos
As noites do rio ao luar
Vejo a mesma luz
Vejo o mesmo ceu
Vejo o mesmo mar
And not only that, I'm in love with her
The most exciting way
It's written on my lips
Where her kisses stay
She smiles and all of a sudden
The world is smiling for me
And you know what else
She's a carioca
Ela é carioca
