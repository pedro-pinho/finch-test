The Jazz 'n'Samba, the Jazz 'n'Samba 
Hear it all around 
The Jazz'n'Samba the Jazz'n'Samba, sound 
The Jazz 'n'Samba, the Jazz 'n'Samba 
Swingin'soft and low 
The Jazz 'n'Samba, the Jazz 'n'Samba, go! 
Jet from Rio, nonstop USA 
This new sound came one day and it's clear 
That it's here to stay 
It's Jazz'n'Samba 
It's so refreshing 
Like a new perfume 
It's Jazz'n'Samba 
It's Jazz'n'Samba 
Ummm!
