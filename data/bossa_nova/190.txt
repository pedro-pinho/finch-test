Quiet nights of quiet stars,
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams,
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And the window that look south of Corcovado
Oh! How lovely
Quero a vida sempre assim,
Com você perto de mim,
Ate o apagar da velha chama
E eu que era triste,
Descrente desse mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que e a felicidade, meu amor
This is where I want to be,
Here with you so close to me,
Until the final flicker of life's ember
I who was lost and lonely,
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke,
Have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh my love
