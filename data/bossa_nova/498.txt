Someone's just outside, knocking at my door
A stranger, somebody unknown
Someone's in my dreams, can't get it off my mind, yeah
I'm tired of being alone
Someone's trying to find an easy way inside
Come on, i'm right here at home, right at home
Is it you?
Is it you?
Is it you?
Is it you, you, you?
Who's that deep inside me, sneaking around my heart?
Are you somebody in love?
Show me what you're doing and tell me who you are
Hey, i'm ready for love, for love
Is it you?
Is it you?
Is it you?
Is it you, you, you?
If it's you, come out in the open
You don't need to hide your love
If it's you, you know i'm hoping
'cause it's way too late to run away
Don't run away from love, my love
Is it you?
Is it you, knocking at my door?
Is it my imagination?
Is it you, i can't get off my mind?
Is it you, you, you?
Is it you, sneaking around my heart?
Is it my imagination?
Is it you, i can`t get off my mind?
You, you, you?
