You take the blue train
The sun on your head
The sun takes the blue train
With you in my head
The sun on your head
Things that come sometimes
And we forget to say
Phrases in the wind
Now an then come to remind
Of things that have remained
For a long time to be said
In the wind a song (whispered bu the wind)
A love song wants to fly, fly
So you take the blue train
The sun on your head
The sun takes the blue train
With you in my head
The sun on your head
Você pega o trem azul
O sol na cabeça
O sol pega o trem azul
Você na cabeça
O sol na cabeça
