Let there be flowers
Let there be spring
We have few hours to save our dream
Let there be light
Let the bird sing
Let the forest be forever green
Little blue planet
In great need of care
Crystal clear streams
Lots of clean air
Let's save the Earth
What a wonderful thing
Let it be forever green
Imagine Mother Earth become a desert
A poison sea, a venomous lagoon
And life on Planet Earth be gone forever
And God will come and ask for planet blue
What to do?
Where is the paradise
I've made for you?
Where is the green?
And where is the blue?
Where is the house
I've made for you?
Where is the forest and
Where is the sea?
Where is the place good for you, good for me?
Let's save the Earth
What a wonderful thing
Let the bird fly, let the bird sing
(Let them sing Luisa)
Let it be forever evergreen
Where is the paradise
I've made for you?
Where is the green?
And where is the blue?
Where is the house
I've made for you?
