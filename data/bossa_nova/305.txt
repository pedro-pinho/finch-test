On my way, (on my way)
I laugh with you, (I laugh with you)
On my way
With you
On my way, (on my way)
I laugh with you, (I laugh with you)
On my way
With you
And it seems so foggy
And it feels so distant to me
And it sounds so funny
And it feels so different to me
As the shrouds  around the dogwood trees
Going down that road sitting next to me
Little texas' girl, looking over at me
Saying, on my way
