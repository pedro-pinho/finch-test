I was alone thinking I was just fine
I wasn't looking for anyone to be mine
I thought that love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station
Home, alone, that was my consignment
Solitary confinement
So when we met I was getting around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
[chorus]
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you (honey/baby)
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you (honey/baby)
I didn't know I was looking for love
I didn't know I was looking for love
Coz there we stood and I would oh I wonder could
I say what I felt and not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed then
Slap on the lap of my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
[repeat chorus]
So we build from here with love the foundation
In a world were tears are consolation
Now you're here there's a full brass band
Playing in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless, boundless I surround you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
