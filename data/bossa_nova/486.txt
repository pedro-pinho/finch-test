There's no reason to feel down
Good and sad goes around,
Life will flow with your decisions
You know that trying isn't too bad,
Even if you fall you'll get ahead
When you slip into precision
All that you can see
Keeps on going never stops,
Like the waterfall keepfalling
And no obstacle makes it static.
Wait until the downing
Wait until it's morning,
Wait until tomorrow comes
You know that sometimes
It might get hard
It's not so easy we get along
But you can always change you viewing"
Things could never be the same
You choose the colors that you paint,
It's just a matter of believing
