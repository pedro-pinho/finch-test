To the ends of the Earth
I'll follow my star
To the ends of the Earth
Just to be where you are
No matter where you roam
I'll never be far behind
Who care where the path may wind
As long as I find you ?
Though the melody dies
The song lingers on your arms
And a thousand goodbyes
Won't convince me you're gone
I'll follow you, my love
You'll never be free
To the ends of the Earth
Till you've given your love to me
