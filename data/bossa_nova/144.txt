I see the wonder in your eyes
Let the rhythm hypnotize
Let it take your mind away
Groove, let's get closer than before
Let's imagine something more
Then we'll make it real today
And don't say goodbye tonight
Save that kiss for the mornin' light
Till the sun comes up, we'll be lost in us
Don't say goodbye
The night was made for love, love
Oh, maybe you should lose your keys
And your responsibilities
They can wait another day
Baby, the street's a danger zone
Don't go out there all alone
You'll feel better if you stay
And don't say goodbye tonight
Save that kiss for the mornin' light
Till the sun comes up, we'll be lost in us
Don't say goodbye
The night was made for love, love
And don't say goodbye tonight
Save that kiss for the mornin' light
Till the sun comes up, we'll be lost in us
Don't say goodbye
The night was made for love, love
Oh, if this night was made for two
You know what we need to do
Let me spend it all with you
Let me spend it all with you
