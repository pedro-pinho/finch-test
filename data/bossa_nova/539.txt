I've spent my life
Waiting for you
Night after night
Dreaming of you
The sky was blue
So bright and blue
I had it all
And so did you
( I remember you smiling )
You were so pretty
You were so pretty oh yeah
You were so pretty
You are so pretty
Oh yeah
This time has passed
But I have not
Cause know you're gone
But not forgot
The sky was blue
So bright and blue
I had it all
And so did you
( I remember you smiling )
You were so pretty
You were so pretty oh yeah
You were so pretty
You are so pretty
Oh yeah
( I remember you smiling )
You were so pretty (um beijo seu)
You are so pretty oh yeah (imaginei)
You are so pretty (e era t√£o bom)
You are so pretty ( que acreditei)
