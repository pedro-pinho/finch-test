I know that you were standing there,
Cause I could never get your face out of my head
And I know that you could come back here
So that is why i'm standing where you were
I've waited for so long
I've never felt like this before
You were walking, dancing
Floating with me
Smiling, shining, morning sunrise
Everybody noticed, caught my eyes
I looked around since you went aeay
It's funny how it feels now that you are gone
All has faded
Day has turned to night
