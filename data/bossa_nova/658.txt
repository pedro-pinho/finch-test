Once, I loved 
And I gave so much love to this love you were the world to me 
Once I cried at the thought I was foolish and proud and let you say goodbye 
Then one day from my infinite sadness you came and brought me love again 
Now I know that no matter whatever befalls I'll never let you go 
I will hold you close 
Make you stay 
Because love is the saddest thing when it goes away 
Love is the saddest thing when it goes away
