Some people sing in the shower
Some people piss in the sea
Some want to be Lady Gaga
And that's alright with me
Whatever you want you can be
Some people live for the power
Some people live on the streets
Some are rich and famous
And some are poor but sweet
Some people like to be hardcore
Some are scared of be bitch
Some are always competing
And some just want to be free
Viva liberty
Whatever you want, you can be
Viva liberty
