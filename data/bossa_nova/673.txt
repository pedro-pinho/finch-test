Isabella
Wake up the sun is coming
Through the window
We're riding with the sun
I feel your heart beat
The morning light plays in your eyes
With floating blue and white skyline
A city in the skies for Isabella
We're gazing through the clouds
We sail the wind rose (four winds)
The break of day sparks my desire
And ocean waves won't quench the fire
We kiss we're high, we're riders in the sky
The city lies below
A sillouete, a glow
A tale of passion
I close my eyes (full flaps downs)
You hold me tight
We touch the ground
Isabella
Our hopes are riding over the city
We search the busy streets
We're not alone here
The city lights flare my desire
A million tears won't quench the fire
And if it starts to rain
We'll take a train
