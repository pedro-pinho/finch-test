We are a new ideia, we are a brand new start,
We are a billion people, our heart beat as one
We are the ones that caused it, We are the ones that cry
We are a drink of water, the holy drink of wine
We are the ones that did it, we are the ones we blame
We are the ones we've given, we are the ones we take.
We are the ones we wanted, we are the ones we've lost,
We are the ones we like, we are the ones we don't
Open your eyes face to the sky
You might just find a place to remind
You that
We are the newest vision, we are a brand new start
We are the deepest secret lost in mysterious heart
We are a single phrase, we are that same old song,
We are what we fight for, if we are right or wrong.
We are under the sun, we shine inside the light
We are the darkest night, the quietness of the stars,
We are our own deception, we are what we believe,
We are the one who's thinking, we are what we want
Open your eyes face to the sky
You might just find a place to remind
There's something inside you,
The same thing inside me
In silence i cry, the world is one.
We are a new ideia, we are a brand new start
We are a billion people, tomorrow is up to us
We are the new inventions, we are the air we breathe,
We are what we think, we are who we want
We are a single voice, we are in everyone
We are famous dreamers, we are unknow stars
We are our own free will, we are our only choice,
We are the ones we like, We are the ones we like...
We shine inside the light...
