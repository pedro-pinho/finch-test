You're so good to me
and your love's the inspiration that I need
Writing songs for you
Is the way I find to thank you for this
Face the music
Dance to the music
now I hear the sound of music
and your kisses take it closer to perfection
You're beyond imagination
We're the dream team
you're so good to me
You're so good to me
and I hope to give you back the peace of mind
that you give to me
and it feels like Bossa Nova by Jobim
The solution to my dilemma
you're my girl from Ipanema
inspiration for my samba in slow motion
you're the top you're my devotion
my slow motion Bossa Nova dream
