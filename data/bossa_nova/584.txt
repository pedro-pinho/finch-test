Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Ela é carioca
She's a carioca
Just see the way she walks
Nobody else can be
What she is to me
I look and what do I see
When I look deep in her eyes
I can see the sea
A forgotten road
The caressing skies
And not only that I'm in love
With her
The most exciting way
It's written on my lips
Where her kisses stay
She smiles and all of a sudden
The world is smiling for me,
And you know what else she's a carioca
Ela é carioca
Here she comes
Here she comes
Ela é carioca
Ela é carioca,
basta o jeitinho dela andar
e ninguém tem carinho assim,
para dar.
Eu vejo na luz dos seus olhos
as noites do frio ao luar
Eu vejo a mesma luz,
vejo o mesmo cé,
vejo o mesmo mar.
And not only that I'm in love
With her
The most exciting way
It's written on my lips
Where her kisses stay
She smiles and all of a sudden
The world is smiling for me,
And you know what else she's a carioca
Ela é carioca
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes
