When I arrived in New York 
The immigration officer asked me 
Where have you been Mr. Bim 
Where have you been, Joe 
You've been abroad for too long Mr. Bim 
Haven't you been? 
I got to the Hotel exhausted to my room 
Having to attend a cocktail 
Late that afternoon 
And there my boss Nesuhi 
An old friend of Jobim's said: 
May introduce you to Gloria? 
By all means 
Buy all jeans 
I've never been in Paris for the summer 
I've never drank a Scotch with this bouquet 
My life is such a mess let's have a Brahma 
I'm happy that you called, 
I really feel touché 
Oh, it's been a long, a very long time 
Since a Brazilian has been in Paris com você 
You look so cute there wearing my pajamas 
You look so sexy with my pince-nez 
Let's hijack this Concord to the Bahamas 
Come on dress up my love 
Let's go to the ballet 
Oh, it's been a long, a very long time 
Since a Brazilian has danced with you 
Le pas-de-deux
