Why did you go, why did you lie and cheat 
And then act like if I was wrong?
Why did you fight, 
why did you hide and cry, 
And then leave us all along?
Why did you say that? 
Why did you do that for?
Why did you fake, 
why did you take that from me 
And then brake all the rules?
Why did you run, 
Why did you pretend to care, 
If you mumbled all the truth?
Why did you go so far? 
Where do you run so far? 
Why do you play games?
Why did you fall, 
Why did you crawl, 
Beg, twist and turn making it all confused?
Why did you move, 
Why did you choose that groove, 
Wasting all your use?
Why did you go so far? 
Where do you run so far? What is left to say?
Do you feel saddened now? Do you feel lonely now?
