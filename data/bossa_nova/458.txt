I was half in mind - I was half in need,
And as the rain came down - I dropped to my knees and prayed
I said oh heavenly thing - please cleanse my soul,
I've seen all on offer and I'm not impressed at all.
I was halfway home - I was half insane,
And every shop window I looked in just looked the same
I said send me a sign to save my life
'cause at this moment in time there is nothing certain in
These day's of mine
Y'see it's a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked (I might as well stay)
And promise myself each and every day - that -
When you're knocked on your back - an' your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top - shout!
