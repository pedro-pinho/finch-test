I'd rather know if you have turned the page
If you go faster than I do
Suddenly it's not so clear just what I am to you
Am I friend? Am I lover? Do we still need each other?
When you touch me, when you touch me, baby I can tell
What do we mean to each other? Am I friend? Am I lover? Is it over now?
If this is it, then why bother? Tell me where do we take it from here?
What do we mean to each other? Am I friend? Am I lover? Is it over now?
Do you love me still or do you just mean well?
I can see clearly how I'm hurting you
Every breath gives you away
Are we going separate roads? Has pride got in the way?
Am I friend? Am I lover? Do we still need each other?
When you hold me, when you hold me, baby I can tell
What do we mean to each other? Am I friend? Am I lover? Is it over now?
If this is it, then why bother? Tell me where do we take it from here?
What do we mean to each other? Am I friend? Am I lover? Is it over now?
Do you love me still or do you just mean well?
Time became the poison working slowly on my heart
Destroying all the memories, Is it tearing us apart?
When you touch me, when you touch me baby I can tell
What do we mean to each other? Am I friend? Am I lover? Is it over now?
If this is it, then why bother? Tell me where do we take it from here?
What do we mean to each other? Am I friend? Am I lover? Is it over now?
Do you love me still or do you just mean well?
What do we mean to each other? Am I friend? Am I lover? Is it over now?
If this is it, then why bother? Tell me where do we take it from here?
What do we mean to each other? Am I friend? Am I lover? Is it over now?
Do you love me still or do you just mean well?
Do you love me still or do you just mean well?
