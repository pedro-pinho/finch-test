Mr. Toquinho, bring your guitar along
The city is lonely and foggy
Let's send our troubles to the deuse
Let's sing a song to love in the making
In the aching, in the breaking
In this god forsaken blues
Mr. guitarman, let's go and get a bottle
Ought to forget all forgiveness
I'm just another weary soul
No use pretending, got to face it
Got to exit, understanding
That I'll just have to end in the blues
